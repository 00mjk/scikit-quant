The sciki-quant repository contains several packages that are individually
licensed. All of them are free to use for academic users. The rewrites of
ImFil (opt/imfil)and SnobFit (opt/snobfit) may require additional approval
from their original authors for non-academic uses. For this reason, these
packages are released separately on PyPI.

The released scikit-quant package on PyPI is itself covered by LBNL BSD.
